# Rock vs. Mine Prediction  

The **Rock vs. Mine Prediction** project is designed to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines using machine learning techniques. This project implements Logistic Regression, a powerful algorithm for binary classification, with the help of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

## Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately identifies whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine. This has practical applications in fields like underwater exploration and defense systems. The dataset consists of sonar signal attributes, enabling the development of a robust classification model.

## Key Features  

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - A preprocessed dataset containing features of underwater sonar signals is used.  
   - Data cleaning and transformation are performed using Pandas for efficient analysis.  

2. **Train-Test Split**  
   - The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance effectively.  

3. **Logistic Regression Model**  
   - Logistic Regression is employed to create the classification model.  
   - This algorithm is well-suited for binary tasks and is implemented using Scikit-learn.  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluation metric (in this, accuracy score) assesses model performance.  

5. **Predictive System**  
   - The project includes a real-time predictive system to classify unseen sonar data.  
   - Input features can be tested to determine if an object is a rock or a mine.
